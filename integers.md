# A list of examples of integer usages:

### add numbers:
```

>>> 2
```
### subtract numbers:
```
print 9 - 8
>>> 1
```
### multiply numbers:
```
print 2 * 3
>>> 6
```
### divide numbers:
```
print 8 / 4
>>> 2
```
### what happens when dividing a number that have a remainder?
### for example the result of this will be only the quotient:
```

```
### to be compatible with python 3:
```
print 5 // 3
>>> 1
```
### to get the only the remainder:
```
print 5 % 3
>>> 2
```
### 2 power 3:
